# Smart Gas Booking and Safety System

## Abstract

The Smart Gas Booking and Safety System using IoT is designed to enhance convenience and safety in LPG usage. This system automates gas cylinder booking by monitoring gas levels using weight sensors and sending alerts via a mobile app when refilling is needed. Additionally, it includes a gas leakage detection module that triggers an alarm and automatically shuts off the gas supply while notifying users via SMS or app notifications. The integration of IoT ensures real-time monitoring, improving safety and efficiency in household and commercial gas usage.
